# Water-Quality-Datasets

The data presented are a subset of those used in Weller et al. (2024) and Murphy et al (2025). Table 1 in Weller et al. (2024) and Table 1 in Murphey et al (2025) lists all datasets used by said publication including appropriate citations. Datasets are only included here if the data owners gave permission for the data to be shared, and the data were not already publicly available. The data included here do not represent the full dataset (e.g., GPS coordinates, site names, and waterway names were dropped); please reach out to the data owners for the full dataset. Some of the variables in these datasets were added by Weller et al. (2024) and Murphey et al (2025) and will not be included in the full dataset provided by the data owners (e.g., methods variables). 

If you download and use a given dataset, cite the original data source(s) as well as Weller at al. (2024) and Murphy et al (2025). If the dataset was generated by a citizen science organization or is available online AND is described in a peer-review paper (e.g., CSI) please cite the citizen science website (e.g., https://www.communityscience.org/), the peer-review paper (e.g., Weller et al. 2022) and the present papers [Weller et al. (2024); Murphy et al. (2025)]. The citation for the original data source and websites can be found by linking the dataset name (e.g., CSI, DUCK, LW) with Table 1 in Weller at al. (2024) or Murphy et al (2025).

12. huc4.nm.nhd: Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 4, representing the watershed subregion where the sample was collected. This is not available for datasets reporting pathogen data
14. usda.regions: USDA Region () where the sample was collected
15. epa.regions EPA Region () where the sample was collected
16. fresh: Freshwater status of the sampled waterway (i.e., freshwater or brackish/saltwater)
17. water_type: Fine-scale Water Type (see Table X for list of possible levels)
